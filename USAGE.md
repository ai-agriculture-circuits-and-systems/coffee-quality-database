X = df[features]
y = df['Total.Cup.Points']

# Split data and train model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 2. Regional Classification
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Classify coffee by region based on quality attributes
features = ['Aroma', 'Flavor', 'Aftertaste', 'Acidity', 'Body', 'Balance']
X = df[features]
y = df['Country.of.Origin']

# Train model to predict origin
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 1. Quality Score Distribution
```python
import seaborn as sns

# Quality score distribution by country
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Country.of.Origin', y='Total.Cup.Points', data=df)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title('Quality Score Distribution by Country')
```

### 2. Attribute Correlation Heatmap
```python
# Correlation heatmap of quality attributes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
